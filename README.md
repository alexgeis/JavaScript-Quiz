# 04 Web APIs: Code Quiz

# JavaScript-Quiz

## Your Task

As a full-stack web developer, youâ€™ll likely be asked to complete a coding assessment&mdash;perhaps as part of an interview process. A typical coding assessment includes both multiple-choice questions and interactive coding challenges.

To help familiarize you with these tests and allow you to use the skills covered, this application is a coding quiz with multiple-choice questions.

## User Story

```
AS A student of Javascript
I WANT to take a timed quiz on JavaScript fundamentals that stores high scores
SO THAT I can gauge my progress and practice for interviews
```

## Acceptance Criteria

```
GIVEN I am taking a code quiz

WHEN I click the start button
THEN a timer starts and I am presented with a question

WHEN I answer a question
THEN I am presented with another question

WHEN I answer a question incorrectly
THEN time is subtracted from the clock

WHEN all questions are answered or the timer reaches 0
THEN the game is over

WHEN the game is over
THEN I can save my initials and my score
```

## Description

First, I broke down the required sections and created the HTML structure for my page. I planned to hide irrelevent elements using JS, so the HTML has all sections on it.

After created all the JS element references required, I created an array to store my questions and answers. I decided to use an array of objects so I could call for certain key value pairs dynamically.

Next, I created event listeners and the functions I would need to trigger processes and navigate through my 1-page site. These functions include rendering certain elements dynamically, triggering the countdown timer, iterating through the question array to pull questions/answers, checking the correct/incorrect answer, and posted user inputs to local storage so I can post in a display.

Finally, I lightly styled the page to help with legibility.
